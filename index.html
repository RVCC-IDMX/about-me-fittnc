            <h2>Literary work</h2>
            <div>
                <p>There was a long spell of silence, a big, aching void, and then from the Professor a keen "S-s-s-s!" He
                pointed; and far down the avenue of yews we saw a white figure advance--a dim white figure, which held
                something dark at its breast. The figure stopped, and at the moment a ray of moonlight fell upon the
                masses of driving clouds and showed in startling prominence a dark-haired woman, dressed in the
                cerements of the grave. We could not see the face, for it was bent down over what we saw to be a
                fair-haired child. There was a pause and a sharp little cry, such as a child gives in sleep, or a dog as
                it lies before the fire and dreams. We were starting forward, but the Professor's warning hand, seen by
                us as he stood behind a yew-tree, kept us back; and then as we looked the white figure moved forwards
                again. It was now near enough for us to see clearly, and the moonlight still held. My own heart grew
                cold as ice, and I could hear the gasp of Arthur, as we recognised the features of Lucy Westenra. Lucy
                Westenra, but yet how changed. The sweetness was turned to adamantine, heartless cruelty, and the purity
                to voluptuous wantonness. Van Helsing stepped out, and, obedient to his gesture, we all advanced too;
                the four of us ranged in a line before the door of the tomb. Van Helsing raised his lantern and drew the
                slide; by the concentrated light that fell on Lucy's face we could see that the lips were crimson with
                fresh blood, and that the stream had trickled over her chin and stained the purity of her lawn
                death-robe.</p>

                <p>We shuddered with horror. I could see by the tremulous light that even Van Helsing's iron nerve had
                failed. Arthur was next to me, and if I had not seized his arm and held him up, he would have fallen.</p>

                <p>When Lucy--I call the thing that was before us Lucy because it bore her shape--saw us she drew back with
                an angry snarl, such as a cat gives when taken unawares; then her eyes ranged over us. Lucy's eyes in
                form and colour; but Lucy's eyes unclean and full of hell-fire, instead of the pure, gentle orbs we
                knew. At that moment the remnant of my love passed into hate and loathing; had she then to be killed, I
                could have done it with savage delight. As she looked, her eyes blazed with unholy light, and the face
                became wreathed with a voluptuous smile. Oh, God, how it made me shudder to see it! With a careless
                motion, she flung to the ground, callous as a devil, the child that up to now she had clutched
                strenuously to her breast, growling over it as a dog growls over a bone. The child gave a sharp cry, and
                lay there moaning. There was a cold-bloodedness in the act which wrung a groan from Arthur; when she
                advanced to him with outstretched arms and a wanton smile he fell back and hid his face in his hands.</p>

                <p></p>She still advanced, however, and with a languorous, voluptuous grace, said:--

                <p>Come to me, Arthur. Leave these others and come to me. My arms are hungry for you. Come, and we can
                rest together. Come, my husband, come!"</p>

               <p>There was something diabolically sweet in her tones--something of the tingling of glass when
                struck--which rang through the brains even of us who heard the words addressed to another. As for
                Arthur, he seemed under a spell; moving his hands from his face, he opened wide his arms. She was
                leaping for them, when Van Helsing sprang forward and held between them his little golden crucifix. She
                recoiled from it, and, with a suddenly distorted face, full of rage, dashed past him as if to enter the
                tomb.</p>
