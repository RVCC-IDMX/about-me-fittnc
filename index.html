            <!--    Biographical info-->

            <h2>Biography and Hobbies</h2>
            <p> Fishing, Gaming, and going to the gym are probably my most favorite things to do. But between all those hobbies I'll tell you a fun story about fishing. As a kid, I've always loved fishing, mostly due to my grandpa taking me at the young age of 4 years old. I can never forget the first fish I ever caught. I have no idea what fish it was but, 
                it was 100% big enough to pull me into the water. The thrill of hooking that fish stayed with me for all those years, but part of it was also the fear of being dragged into the water. It's funny though because 
            it wasn't a fish when I pulled it out. It turned out to be a turtle, the softshell turtle that became a delicacy in China. That memory isn't the only thing that stayed with me though because I wasn't raised in America. Yes I was born here but for the first
        7 years of my life I lived in China. Moving here was hard due to the lack of social interaction, but mostly because of the language barrier. Moving here was hard and learning a new culture was even harder. Yet, as time went on my knowledge grew and eventually I 
    adapted to the new surroundings. Looking back on things now I'm grateful for moving here and meeting all the people I call family here, blood-related or not. When I saw snow for the first time it seemed magical, my sister and I loved playing in the snow but as time went
on she got tired of it and refused to play with me. Life eventually set in and instead of playing, now I just shovel the driveway. Thanks-giving just past and it really made me think of what and who I was thankful for, and connecting everything together I can only be
thankful for moving to America because people here are who I consider my real family. (I had to leave China because of my grandpa's money spending issue and he owed money to gangsterðŸ˜‘ðŸ˜‘ðŸ˜‘) </p>

        <article id="blog">
            <h2>Blog</h2>
            <div>
                <p> This is my first year working on Web Dev, so far, this program has been really thrilling. Learning how much work it takes to create a website is intriguing. Looking back now, I feel as if the hard work of some websites is really underappreciated.
                    But as my classes come to an end, I am required to finish some finals, and for my final in Web Dev, I've decided to do a research blog about CSS Sprites. So, what are they? </p> 

                    <p>CSS Sprites are a type of technique in web development, that involves combining multiple images into a single image file to reduce the number of HTTP requests made by the browser. This method is commonly used to improve web page load times, 
                      especially when dealing with icons, buttons, or other small images. The history of sprites dates back all the way to 1975, the word sprites came from a technique in computer graphics, mostly used in video games. The idea was to have an image
                    downloaded to its memory and show parts of the image. By doing that, it'll speed up the process of videos and clips. Before this, a program would have to continuously download new images which took a lot longer. This program at first was made for
                the increase in video games and they tried to level up their program game to give audiences a better game. A good example would be the older pixel PokÃ©mon games. The Sprite sheet consisted of over 1000 graphic objects. Even in the present sprites are
            still used in every website. It's the simple buttons and icons no one really pays attention to, like the buy button on Amazon, or even the logos people keep.</p>

            <p>Even in our present-day format, CSS Sprites are still used but it's also evolved. The benefits of using them now are a reduced number of HTTP requests, reduced overall image size, independence of JavaScript, reduced loading time, and Flexibility.
                However, even with all those pros, everything comes with cons as well. The Demerits of CSS Sprites are higher development time, more maintenance time, and less SEO friendly. Seo friendly just means it's easier for search engines to crawl and understand the 
                structure and content of a website. </p>

                <p>So how do you actually use CSS Sprites? It seems to be somewhat "simple." You insert images and by positioning them and moving them in certain areas, you're able to show certain images that's already downloaded and don't have to download new images 
                    which can take a lot longer. By using background-repeat: no-repeat; you're able to show only what you want to show with positioning. Most of the positioning is controlled by the command (width: and height:) Other commands used are (background-image and background-position)
                A good example would be 
                <div>.flags-canada {
                    height: 128px;
                    background-position: -5px -5px;}</div>
                </p>
                <p>As we near the end of this blog, i feel as if we should go over what we talked about today. We learned the history of Css Sprites along with the many uses it hold before and now as well. We also went over the ways of using it along with an
                    example, and I won't lie this kind of opened my eyes to web dev because now I know how the pokemon games got made.
