## Description
 #### Week 1-2:
During these weeks I found a passion for making websites due to the freedom I have to make whatever I want and not what someone else wants. We learned about files and how to finish easy assignments. 

#### Week 3-4:
This week might of been the most important week for me because this is when we started to really put in code. Links, pictures, and HTML were the main focus. We also linked projects into GitHub and Netlify.

#### Week 5-6:
First time working with CSS and it was really hard. Everything was so confusing yet interesting. At this time, we also started to add styles which came out really well.

#### Week 7-8: 
I can't say how hard this week was for me. The CSS really took control when we started learning Grid Games, and it became the most confusing things I've ever seen. I had a lot of trouble finding motivation and powering through these complicated times. 

#### Week 9-10:
Truthfully this midterm might be the best midterm I've ever took. This midterm really put everything I learned to the test. For me everything seemed easy even though I didn't study. But once again at the middle of week 10 I got confused again due to CSS. 

#### Week 11-14: 
Finally at the present, but during these days might be the hardest yet. Catching up on nav bar wasn't hard but I think finishing this project will be the most difficult thing yet.
    
 ### What I learned
    During my time in this class, I've learned the basics of website development. I've learned how to insert links, images, overall, how websites are actually built. (It's a lot more work than I thought) The Professor also touched up upon adding borders, having a color scheme, and videos. My About Me is about the hobbies I entertainment myself with through my life. I even included my Instagram cooking account. This website has been about me since day one and I'm really proud of it. Throughout the semester I believe my favorite assignment to be the create your own website with three pictures and logo. I made mine into a restaurant due to my passion for cooking. I definitely need to say thank you for a great professor though because I think this is the first time I had fun in a class. Big thank you for the fishing talks too, I really appreciated those.
